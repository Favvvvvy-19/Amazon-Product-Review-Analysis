## 📊 Amazon Product Review Analysis
A DSA Data Analysis Project aimed at generating insights that can guide products improvement, marketing strategies and customer engagement

In this case study, I assumed the role of a **Junior Data Analyst** at **RetailTech Insights**, a company specializing in e-commerce analytics for sellers on platforms like Amazon.

The objective of the project was to analyze customer review data to uncover actionable insights that could inform business strategy.

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Electronics** had the highest number of customer reviews, with **in-ear electronic accessories** emerging as the most frequently rated sub-category.
- This category also accounted for the **highest potential revenue**, indicating strong customer engagement and sales performance.
- The **Computers & Accessories** category followed closely in terms of review volume, though it lagged significantly behind Electronics in overall performance.
- **Discount levels did not show a direct correlation with product ratings**. Interestingly, products with just a **2% discount** had an **average rating of 4.5**—the highest across all discount tiers.
- Categories such as **Car & Motorbike Accessories** and **Health & Personal Care** had the **lowest number of reviews**, suggesting opportunities for improved product visibility and customer engagement in these segments.
